              <p>
                Surreal adventure bike and hike day. We started from the van down low to access the Iztaccihuatl trailhead. Popocatepetl or Popo provided a breathtaking backdrop with its continuous eruptions.
              </p>
              <p>Popo was on the front page of the Wall Street Journal 4 days after we summited Izta. The park that we stayed at was closed and a couple of nearby towns were evacuated. In the end Popo did not go off and is still quite active to this day.</p>

                Maybe Madison remembers the guys name who gave us a tour of his shop. Nonetheless he was very sweet and we shared Mezcal together and also bought some super awesome hand towels. The towels have proven to be extremely durable.
